> "Problem-driven builder". I create tools for my own challenges, share them publicly, and explore AI-powered solutions that amplify impact. I build what I need, refine it through learning, and evolve it into solutions for the world to use.

## What I'm Doing
- **Learning by building** - Turning concepts into working systems, not notes
- **Compounding skills** - Turning every project into reusable leverage
- **Thinking in systems** - Designing scalable, composable architectures rather than one-off solutions
- **Learning in public** - Building, breaking, and refining ideas openly
